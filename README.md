## Sensitivity of TALYS Model Parameters for Medical Isotope Production Cross Sections

This repository contains Python scripts designed for a sensitivity study of the model parameters used in the nuclear reaction model code [TALYS](https://nds.iaea.org/talys/). The goal is to optimize the production cross sections of medical isotopes. These scripts provide functionality to:

- Perform TALYS calculations for isotopes listed in the IAEA Medical Isotope Evaluation.
- Read and analyze output files generated by TALYS.
- Obtain optimized chi-square values using the least-squares method.

By leveraging these tools, users can systematically refine TALYS parameters to improve the reliability of medical isotope production data.

## How to run the code
First, you need to install necessary Python packages by running
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To execute the sensitivity study, simply run the following command in your terminal:
```
python calc.py
```

## Documentation
The documentation is available online in IAEA Nuclear Data Section website as [IAEA-NDS-0249](https://doi.org/10.61092/iaea.8j2z-vz4q).
